## PHP Best Practices

This Repository wants to help php developers to learn php best practices through examples in a sample project.

The sample project is a simple blog but these practices which we talk about are for php Large Scale Applications.

I kept the project small just for the purpose of simplicity.

I've done so many php projects (php pure code, laravel , yii2, zend1, zend2, slim, symfony) and
This is what I learnt from my php former projects.

### These Best Practices includes:

1) Create Scalable Project
    1-1) Code structure and design patterns
    1-2) Performance Related Notes
    1-3) No issues with database clustering
    1-4) No issues with application load balancing
    
2) Let New Project Members Learn Project Fast and start contributing to it
    2-1) How dispatching tasks
    2-2) How you should write code so everybody easily understands your code without asking you.

3) quickly find database slow queries

4) Periodically Deployment without worrying about breaking build using tests


5) You don't need to worry about how your application is going to be called (http request | console command | ...)
    
    
6) How to document your project so every new Team member can quickly get acquainted.



I hope this repository helps new php developers to improve their skills to deal with more advanced php projects easily.
I also hope to get help from anybody who thinks he/she can help me improve this repository.

### Notice:
Almost all of codes in this repo are pseudo code, so you can't install composer packages and build and deploy this project.
Maybe in future I try to work on codes and make them real codes so It can be executed.

Wait for my updates , It's just the beginning.
storm's coming.
